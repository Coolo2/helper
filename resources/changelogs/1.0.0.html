[30th April 2022] 1.0.0 - The long awaited rewrite is finally out!

Back in 2021, Helper was in a bad state. The whole bot was in a mess and half the commands didn't work. 
That's why I decided to rewrite the whole thing, which lead to this version. 
The bot works similarly, yet is easier to use and less buggy overall. Each command and event has been completely written behind the scenes into slash commands.
Please note that as of this version, prefixed (hb/) commands will not work due to changes on Discord. All commands must be requested via slash commands (/help).

<u>Updated commands:</u>

All commands have been rewritten, too many to list here.
Notable changes:
- Warn improvements : Events! (see below)
- Better integration to the dashboard
- Moderation command fixes 
- Slash commands and slash custom commands


<u>Improvements:</u>

Full slash command, slash command permission, and button support
Cleaner commands and simpler usage all round the bot 
<strike>Music is back!</strike> Music will be back soon

Events system: warns can chain other actions when they are trigged: eg 3 warns to ban. See more on the Dashboard
Image commands are faster and less reliant on third parties

<u>Bug fixes:</u>

Every command has been rewritten, therefore hundreds of bugs have been fixed.
Notable bug fixes:
- Moderation commands no longer send a "missing permissions" message alongside a "success" message
